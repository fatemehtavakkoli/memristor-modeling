# memristor-modeling

This project includes simulation and modeling of the **HP memristor** using four different deep learning approaches:

- **PINN**: Physics-Informed Neural Network  
- **LSTM**: Standard Long Short-Term Memory  
- **Simple NN**: Simple Neural Network 
- **PiLSTM**: Physics-Informed-LSTM

Each method is implemented in a separate folder with its corresponding notebook and output plots.
